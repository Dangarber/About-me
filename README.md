# About-me 

  

My project tells about me and how I became interested in tech and coding. It also displays a lot of fun features, animation and creative ways to display my contacts. 

  

First thing you will notice is that my site uses css flex boxes to stretch in align text and images to fit the screen at any height. It even changes font and spacing depending on ratio to give you the best display 

  

My site also uses css to display a typing animation at the top of the screen "A Little Bit About Me." 

  

You will also see a flashing color card at the bottom of the screen as well as a sticky header that follows you as scroll till getting towards the bottom of the screen, at that point it drops off. This is all done using CSS. 

  

Java script is implemented in my page in a card form at the bottom of my page. There is a card labeled "click for contact" this card is hiding my information. You have to click to reveal 

  

I also have a picture of an SNES. When you adjust the screen from desktop to phone view you will see the picture adjust from a wide center position to far left to overall fit the alternate phone view.
